# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to the Dynamic Grid Sketchpad project! This web application allows you to create and interact with a dynamic grid of square divs. You can draw, erase, and explore your creativity in a pixelated canvas.

This project is a great opportunity to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Features

- **Dynamically Generated Grid**: The grid is created using JavaScript, allowing you to specify the number of squares per side.

- **Hover Effect**: When you hover your mouse over a square, it changes color, leaving a trail as you move your cursor.

- **User-Defined Grid Size**: A user-friendly interface lets you input the number of squares per side for the new grid.

## Extra Credit Features

- **Randomized Colors**: Each interaction with a square randomizes its RGB color.

- **Progressive Darkening**: Squares get progressively darker with each interaction, reaching complete black after ten interactions.

## How to Use

1. Hover your mouse over a square to start drawing or coloring.
2. Click and drag for more intricate designs.
3. Use the button at the top to set the grid size for your canvas.

## Technologies Used
